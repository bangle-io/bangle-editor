## What is BangleJS ?

BangleJS is a collection components for building powerful editing experiences for the web.

- :battery: **Batteries included**  
  We expose plenty of components to help you get started with your Editor and

- **Insanely powerful API**  
  Bangle uses [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) to provide API which can help you build the next google docs including [collboration](https://prosemirror.net/examples/collab/#edit-Example).

- **Vanilla JS**  
  BangleJS is written in a framework agnostic way, so that you can focus on building the editor and not learning a new framework. That said, we have support for React and I have plans to add Vue support in the coming months.

- **Customize UI with React (more frameworks to come)**  
  Doing UI in vanilla Javascript is not fun, Bangle comes with first party React support and React components (the ones starting with `@banglejs/react-`) to add some extra :nail_care: oomph to your Editor.

- **:car: Fast as a racing car**  
  Bangle is as fast as a rich text editor can be, try pasting a really long document in one of its example (:wink: don't forget to compare it with your current favourite editor).

<!-- ## Why should I use it ?

## How does it compare with ?

Before I jump into nitty gritty, please know that BangleJS is in **beta** stage and if you are looking for a more mature product, the libraries below will help. But hey, do give BangleJS a try.

- **[Quill](https://quilljs.com/):**

- **[Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/):**

- **[Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate):**

- **[DraftJS](https://draftjs.org/):** -->

### I like it, how should I get started ?

Awesome! head over to Getting started.

Understanding Bangle
In this guide we will be creating a basic editor WSYIWG editor with vanilla JS. The concepts mentioned will also help you when using Bangle with your favourite framework.

Brief#
BangleJS is a library for building powerful text editing experiences for the web. It uses a library called Prosemirror to interface with the contentEditable DOM. Prosemirror is an amazing library, after trying other libraries (slatejs, quilljs, editor.js) I setting with Prosemirror because:

Expressiveness: Other libraries are happy to state that you can build the next google docs with them, but fail to deliver on it. After spending couple of months with Prosemirror, I was clear that the choices the library has made, do infact allow for building powerful editors like google docs or dropbox paper.

Right abstractions: Prosemirror allows

Documentation & Community: Prosemirror has great documentation and their community forums are very helpful.

Collaboration: Live collaboration comes baked in with Prosemirror.

This blog post by Prosemirror's author does a great job on explaining some aspects of it.

Let us understand a basic editor with Bangle and along with that learn a couple of core concepts.

Configuring#
To create an Editor instance you should setup your code like:

As you noticed above, to create an Editor you need to have the following -->
