Hello there,

Thanks for taking out the time to try out

## What is BangleJS ?

BangleJS is a collection components for building powerful text editing experiences for the web.

- :battery: **Batteries included**

  - We expose plenty of components to help you get started with your first Editor and the API is insanely powerful to do

- **Vanilla JS**

  - BangleJS is written in a framework agnostic way, so that you can focus on building the editor and not learning a new framework. That said, we have support for React and I have plans to add Vue support in the coming months.

- **Prosemirror**

  - Many of you might not be familiar with this library, but trust me it is one of star features of BangleJS. [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) is a low level, insanely powerful library for building rich text editors.

  - If you are familiar with Prosemirror, Bangle is the car-fleet you would make out of the Prosemirror lego pieces.

  - **Collborative Editing**

  - **Schema**

  - **Functional**

- **First party support for React (more frameworks to come)** - Doing UI in vanilla Javascript is not fun, Bangle comes with great first party React support and React components (the ones starting with `@banglejs/react-`) to add some extra :nail_care: oomph to your Editor.

- **Fast as a racing car :car: **- Bangle is as fast as a rich text editor can be, try pasting a really long document in one of its example (:wink: don't forget to compare it with your current favourite editor).

## Why should I use it ?

## How does it compare with ?

Before I jump into nitty gritty, please know that BangleJS is in **beta** stage and if you are looking for a more mature product, the libraries below will help. But hey, do give BangleJS a try.
