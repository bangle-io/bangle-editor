import filePath1 from '!!file-loader!./first-editor.example1.jsx';
import createEditor1 from './first-editor.example1';
import { VanillaCodeExample } from '../../src/example-helpers';

To get started with your first Bangle Editor lets look at a basic Bangle setup.

<VanillaCodeExample
  filePath={filePath1}
  language="js"
  createEditor={createEditor1}
  defaultTab="src"
/>

There is a lot going on in the above example, so lets distill it down into smaller parts:

- **Components**: `heading`, `bold`
- **specs**: `heading.spec()`, `bold.spec()`
- **plugins**: `heading.plugins()`, `bold.plugins()`
- **initialValue**: `Hello world!`

## Bangle component

A [component](/docs/api/core#component) is an object which forms building block of a Bangle editor. Let us look at high level overview of the `bold` component:

```js
export const bold = {
    spec() {
        type: 'mark',
        name: 'bold',
        schema: {
            ...
        },
        markdown: {
            ...
        }
    },
    plugins() {
        return [ ... ]
    },
    commands: {
        toggleBold: () => { .... },
        ...
    }
}
```

As you can see the bold component is a collection of functionalities needed by your Editor to
allow your users to **bold** things.

### SpecRegistry or specs

Short for specification, is an object that declaratively defines how your editor behaves, looks, its relationship with other entities and the parsing/serialization aspect of it.
You can either create a SpecRegistry instance yourself or pass an array of specs and let Bangle create it for you internally.

```js
const specs = [bold.spec()];
const state1 = new BangleEditorState({
    specRegistry: new SpecRegistry(specs),
    ...
});
const state2 = new BangleEditorState({
    specs: specs
    ...
});
// state1 and state2 are essentially the same thing
```

:bulb: Using the `specs: [...]` should fit majority of use cases. The `new SpecRegistry` syntax comes in handy when dealing with multiple syncronized editors which need to rely on a single instance of specRegistry
or if your application needs access to {{core.links.Prosemirror.Schema}}.

You might have noticed that we are using a array to order the specs. For most use cases the order doesn't matter,
however if two or more specs are competing, for example, a link spec vs bold spec, putting link spec before bold ensures
that your output will look like `<bold>will wrap <a href="hola">a link tag</a>`.

:book: Handy links:

- [SpecRegistry API](/docs/api/core#specregistry)
- Creating a custom spec with {{Prosemirror.Schema}}.

### Plugins

Plugins allow you to add interactivity to your editor. They allow for things like keyboard shortcuts, drag-n-drop, paste, etc.

:bulb: Not every component has `.plugin()`, as some components are pretty simple, check the API doc of each component before using.

:bulb: There is no explicit connection between a component's `plugins` and `spec`, so feel free to mix, match them or even replace them with your own.

:book: Creating a custom component is a slightly complex topic, as you can pretty much do anything with plugins.
**Only** dig deeper into plugin API if you want to build your own plugins, here are some handy links:

- {{Prosemirror.PluginSpec}}: Simply put, plugins are just an array of {{Prosemirror.PluginSpec}}.
- [Plugins API](/docs/api/core#plugins)

### initialValue

Bangle accepts variety of things as initial value.

- You can use a vanilla string:

```js
new BangleEditorState({
  initialValue: `Hello world`,
});
```

- You can use an html string. Check out [persist to localStorage](/docs/examples/exporting-data) example for more details.

```js
new BangleEditorState({
  initialValue: `<div><p>Hello world</p></div>`,
});
```

- Or a JSON doc. Check out [persist to localStorage](/docs/examples/exporting-data#persisting-to-local-storage) example for more details.

```js
new BangleEditorState({
  initialValue: {
    type: 'doc',
    content: [
      {
        type: 'paragraph',
        content: [
          {
            type: 'text',
            text: 'Hello world',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```
