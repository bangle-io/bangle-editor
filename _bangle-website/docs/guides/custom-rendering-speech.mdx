import filePath from '!!file-loader!./custom-rendering-speech.jsx';
import Component from './custom-rendering-speech';
import { ReactCodeExample } from '../../src/example-helpers';

Up untill this point you might be wondering what is the best way if you want
to change the way a particular node is rendered in the browser. Bangle provides you with few options

- The simplest option is to look at the `style.css` of a component and override it with your own.
- If you only care about the HTML semantics you can modify the
  [toDOM](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.NodeSpec.toDOM) and [parseDOM](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.NodeSpec.parseDOM)
  in your [spec.schema](/docs/api/core#spec). Checkout this cute Prosemirror [example](https://prosemirror.net/examples/dino/) for details.
- If you want all the bells and whistles read on :sunglasses:!

In this guide we will create a component that speaks the words written inside of it with the help of the NodeView API.

Below is the finished product:

<ReactCodeExample
  filePath={filePath}
  language="jsx"
  component={() => <Component />}
/>

### Spec

We create a spec named `speech` having the following fields:

```js
{
  type: 'node',
  name: 'speech',
  schema: {
    content: 'inline*',
    group: 'block',
    draggable: false,
    toDOM,
    parseDOM,
  },
}
```

The schema defines that this component can have 0 or more content of group `inline`.

Next we define the `toDOM` and `parseDOM` fields of the schema. They control how editor serializes and parses
your node. For node views, these fields dictate the exporting of HTML, copy pasting and dragging.

```js
const { toDOM, parseDOM } = domSerializationHelpers(name, {
  tag: 'div',
  content: 0,
});
```

:bulb: `'0'` in Prosemirror world is what `props.children` is in React i.e. dom content can be put in it. See [Proseemirror.DOMOutputSpec](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.DOMOutputSpec) for more details

Since we donot really care about the semantics of the output, we use the helper function `domSerializationHelpers`
which generates a good enough pair of `toDOM` and `parseDOM`.

:book: Read the [Prosemirror.Schema](https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/#schema) guide if you want to dig deeper on what each of the fields in the schema mean.

### Plugins

```js
plugins() {
  return [
    keymap({
      'Ctrl-d': createSpeechNode(),
    }),
    ...
  ];
}
```

In the plugins, we define a keyboard shortcut which allows us to create a new speech node whenever
user presses `Ctrl-d`. Here, `createSpeechNode()` is a command which will insert a new `speech` node for us.

```html
<DOC>
  || EDITOR LAND ||
  <containerDOM>
    || YOUR LAND ||
    <contentDOM> || EDITOR LAND || </contentDOM>
  </containerDOM>
  || EDITOR LAND ||
</DOC>
```

## Rendering

Fully aborbing the visualization above, we create a React component:

```jsx
<div>
  <div className="your-land" contentEditable={false}>
    <select
      onChange={(e) => {
        setLang(e.target.value);
      }}
    >
      <option>some option</option>
    </select>
    <button onClick={onPlay}>Play</button>
  </div>
  {children}
</div>
```

We put all our customization under the div `.your-land`. Bangle will automatically insert `contentDOM` in the `children` to allow for typing in our speech component.

As you notice we have marked just a part of the UI as `contentEditable=false`, this
tells the browser that unlike the rest, this content is not meant to be editable.

:bulb: When creating NodeView UI make sure that all the dom
ancestors of `{children}` are free of `contentEditable=true` or `contentEditable=false`. This helps prevent
`contentEditable` islands, which hamper the free flow of the cursor in your document. Like the example above, tuck
all the custom UI in a single `div` or `span`.

```jsx
// üö´ donot do this as it creates `contentEditable` islands
<div contentEditable={true}>
  <div className="your-land" contentEditable={false}>
    <button onClick={onPlay}>Play</button>
  </div>
  {children}
</div>

// üö´ donot do this as it creates `contentEditable` islands
<div contentEditable={true}>
  <div className="your-land" contentEditable={false}>
    <button onClick={onPlay}>Play</button>
    <div contentEditable={true}>
      {children}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

// üëç this is good
<div>
  <div className="your-land" contentEditable={false}>
    <button onClick={onPlay}>Play</button>
  </div>
  <div>
   {children}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Wiring it all up

In your React component we expect a render prop which will be called whenever
there is an update for any of your node view and based on the type of your node
you can decide what component to render.

```jsx
<BangleEditor
  state={editorState}
  renderNodeViews={({ node, updateAttrs, children }) => {
    if (node.type.name === 'speech') {
      return (
        <Speech node={node} updateAttrs={updateAttrs}>
          {children}
        </Speech>
      );
    }
  }}
/>
```

In the second plugin, we tell Bangle to use a NodeView plugin for rendering the `speech` node. With this
we are on our own on deciding the rendering of this node.

The `contentDOM` and `containerDOM` are names you will hear often in the docs:

- `contentDOM`: Is the dom node which will be the parent of the content. As you know, in our spec
  we defined our node to have any content which is of the group `inline`. So anything that you type
  in the speech node, will be directly housed by this dom node.

- `containerDOM`: This is the outermost node of `speech` node.

The bangle editor will directly interface with these two nodes and leave the things in between for you.
You can visualize this relationship something like this,
where you only control the part demarcated as `YOUR LAND`.

```js
NodeView.createPlugin({
  name: 'speech',
  // The speech component will be mounted on this
  containerDOM: ['div', { class: 'speech-container' }],
  // The dom.Node which Bangle will control to allow for typing of things to speak.
  contentDOM: ['span', { class: 'speech-text' }],
});
```
