## What is bangle.dev ?

bangle.dev is a collection of components for building powerful editing experiences for the web.

- :battery: **Batteries included**\
  We expose plenty of components to help you get started with your Editor.

- **Insanely powerful API**\
  Bangle uses [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) to provide an API which can help you build the next google docs including [collaboration](https://prosemirror.net/examples/collab/#edit-Example).

- **Vanilla JS**\
  Bangle is written in a framework agnostic way, so that you can focus on building the editor and not learning a new framework. That said, we have support for React and I have plans to add Vue support in the coming months.

- **Customize UI with React (more frameworks to come)**\
  Doing UI in vanilla Javascript is not fun. Bangle comes with first party React support and React components (the ones starting with `@bangle.dev/react-`) to add some extra :nail_care: oomph to your Editor.

- **:car: Fast as a racing car**\
  Bangle is as fast as a rich text editor can be; try pasting a really long document in one of its example (:wink: don't forget to compare it with your current favourite editor).

## Getting started

```sh
npm install @bangle.dev/core
```
