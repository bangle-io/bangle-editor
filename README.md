## What is BangleJS ?

BangleJS is a collection components for building powerful editing experiences for the web.

- :battery: **Batteries included**  
  We expose plenty of components to help you get started with your Editor and

- **Insanely powerful API**  
  Bangle uses [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) to provide API which can help you build the next google docs including [collboration](https://prosemirror.net/examples/collab/#edit-Example).

- **Vanilla JS**  
  BangleJS is written in a framework agnostic way, so that you can focus on building the editor and not learning a new framework. That said, we have support for React and I have plans to add Vue support in the coming months.

- **Customize UI with React (more frameworks to come)**  
  Doing UI in vanilla Javascript is not fun, Bangle comes with first party React support and React components (the ones starting with `@banglejs/react-`) to add some extra :nail_care: oomph to your Editor.

- **:car: Fast as a racing car**  
  Bangle is as fast as a rich text editor can be, try pasting a really long document in one of its example (:wink: don't forget to compare it with your current favourite editor).

## Getting started

```sh
npm install @banglejs/core
```
